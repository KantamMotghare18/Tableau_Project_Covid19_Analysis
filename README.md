# Tableau Project: Covid-19 Analysis

## Objective of the Project
To understand Covid-19 Data and Stats in a visual form with the help of Tableau.

## Data Prep. Information

We have used an MS Excel CSV file (covid_19_data) for data analysis.

The file consists of 8 columns/fields and 205,951 rows/records.

The 8 fields are: Sno, ObservationDate, Province/State, Country/Region, Last Update, Confirmed, Deaths, and Recovered.

## Problem Statements

1. What are the total number of confirmed cases in different nations?
2. What are the total number of recovered cases in different nations?
3. Find the highest death rates on an international level.
4. Display the confirmed cases per state in India.
5. Display the recovered cases per state in India.
6. Can we forecast a trend line for Covid-19?
7. Can we find the variation in Covid-19 cases around the world?
8. Which were the outlier Indian states with respect to death and confirmed cases?
9. Display the top 10 countries with respect to confirmed cases alongside death cases.
10. With the help of an area chart, display deaths against the observation date for various countries.

## Conclusion

From analyzing the dataset through visualizations in Tableau, it is evident that:

- USA has recorded the highest deaths (53,579,012).
- India has recorded the highest recovery rate. Thus, we can subtly conclude that Indians have good immunity against Covid-19.
- Maharashtra state has recorded the most number of deaths in India.
- USA has also observed the most confirmed cases (503 million).
- From the trend line, it was observed that Covid-19 cases will go down in 2021.
- US, Brazil, India, Mexico, and the UK are the most affected countries with respect to deaths caused by Covid-19.
